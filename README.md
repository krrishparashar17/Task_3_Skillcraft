Task 03: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation | Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology
I am excited to share that I’ve successfully completed the third task of my Machine Learning internship, which involved building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to differentiate images of cats and dogs using a Kaggle dataset.

Task Objective:To implement an image classification model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Approach and Methodology:Preprocessed a dataset containing 5,000 labeled images for training and 12,500 images for testing.
-Resized images to a uniform dimension of 64×64 pixels and converted them into feature vectors.
-Split the dataset into training and validation sets for model evaluation.
-Trained an SVM classifier using the scikit-learn library with optimized hyperparameters.
-Evaluated the model’s performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
-Saved the trained model and generated predictions for the test images.
-Exported the final predictions and confidence scores into a structured CSV file for analysis.

Key Outcomes:
1)Achieved a validation accuracy of 69.4% with balanced class performance for both cats and dogs.
2)Generated predictions on 12,500 unseen test images, including confidence scores for each prediction.
3)Successfully automated the process of image classification using a classical machine learning technique without relying on deep learning frameworks.

Skills and Concepts Strengthened:
1)Practical implementation of image preprocessing techniques for machine learning models.
2)Hands-on experience with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks.
3)Performance evaluation using classification reports and validation metrics.
4)Model serialization and automated batch prediction generation.
5)CSV-based result management and confidence score analysis.

Looking forward to tackling the next challenge and diving deeper into applied machine learning techniques!
